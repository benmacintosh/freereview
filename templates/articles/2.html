John Duns Scotus said:<br>
In an 'essentially ordered' series of events, every event is caused by the whole history of events<br>
Events can't cause themselves, so there are no loops in these series<br>
It is possible to hold 'perfect' causal power. This power would be neccesarily independant of past causes, i.e. it is a first cause<br>
So it is possible there is a first cause<br>
Then there must actually be a first cause, since otherwise it would be impossible for their to be a first cause<br>
<br>
On the other hand, we could have an 'accidentally ordered series' in which each event only depends on the prior event (i.e. it is made of essential ordered series of size 2)<br>
Each event then depends on the 'form' of this chain of events<br>
This form is not part of the series (but like a family resemblance of events)<br>
But then the accidental ordered series is dependant on a higher order essential cause, so it follows there is a first cause in this case also.<br>
<span id="props"> Are all events related accidentally or essentially? </span>

Duns Scotus also thought thinking was conical.<br>
Nyman thought he thought he mistook his wife for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCWP8VwuDWs&list=OLAK5uy_n56TCQlTDAmV86tIEqwZodJv2v0Rva4ig&index=5"> hat by the river.</a>
What does unthinking look like now?ðŸ¥±<br>

'While You Were Here Do Snoring Lie'<br>
Went past Dowland 'Can She Excuse My Wrongs'<br>
Which went past the Elizabethan tale, 'Shall I Go Walk The Woods So Wild'.<br>

50% of the worlds forests are gone and no longer surveilled by the Royal Institue of Painters of Water. In a forest sits Oku-no-in and the burial place of the Samsung CEO. Nyman's Samsung Cycles came 300 years after Handel's water music. Nyman attempted an opera of Tristram Shandy, leaving behind the 'Nose-List Song' (from Slawkenbergius's Tale) and 'Love is Certainly, at least Alphabetically Speaking' from Shandy's love vocabulary. Greenaway and Nyman never finished a childrens <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qB7L3uItxs">show 'Ganglion'. Nyman was in a Japanese hotel after donating pianos to schools in Kobe. Kenji Eno found and convinced Nyman to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrQRN5nB7xk">compose</a> for him. There is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVRliCUqLPM">Laura</a> in 3 out Eno's 4 games.

<br> Drowning by number 58 is also missing, but you can find it at the same bar of Mozart's Sinafonia. Find me in a carpark <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdGDlMeNyoQ">listening</a> to Walser's microscripts. <br>

The first named astroid was named after a city. Subsequent astroids were named after a living person, then a dog, then a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/935_Clivia">flower</a>, then a cat. And it is thought that a rock from Clivia's home killed the dinosaurs. Give me one chance and I'll leave it.
