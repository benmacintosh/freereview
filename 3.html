	The hare is a bold animal!<br>
He runs until the snare<br>
catches him. Ears pricked; he<br>
listens. For him - there is no time<br>
to rest. Run runs runs.<br>
Poor hare!<br>
<br>
I’m so sad to the fact<br>
that im so selfish about me, a lot of people that<br>
cant confess that about themselves - as far as making money and being a famous person.<br>
I say all the time, I'm so fucking selfish, should take time out to try and<br>
be a father - it hurts alot. It - it hurts a lot, but guess what up,<br>
I’m trying my ass, to try and understand my kids.<br>
Thank you. Even though I fucked, the mother.<br>
</p>

<p>
Morning is cool,<br>
the birds transfix.<br>
The apes alone-,<br>
to be in the trees.<br>
<br>
You know I wanna die - die right, you know I wanna be<br>
frozen, and see people look at me and say, yo I used to fuck with that guy.<br>
And guess what, and I look at their ass and guess what though,<br>
I’m not going - just look at you, like a billboard. You ever see<br>
billboards on the street, and guess what what when you try<br>
and pass by it the eyes still watch you. The eyes are watching.<br>
Do you even notice that shit. Have you noticed that bullshit.<br>
right. Try it.<br>
</p>

<p>
Break a leg comrades<br>
I go off into battle<br>
and not to the bath<br>
break out the sour cream<br>
and howdy there my homeland<br>
<br>
You know, I don’t feel good today. Take care<br>
of yourself. Right.<br>
"That’s what you say to your girls, I don’t feel good?"<br>
- she says that to me. "She said that?" no, women.<br>
"So whos your ideal women at this point"<br>
what?<br>
</p>

<p>
The water lily blooms in the lake.<br>
She is white as now.<br>
The lily is a game with the<br>
water.<br>
<br>
But ah, I’d like to talk about 4 people, 4<br>
individuals thats really impacted im my life, um,<br>
I'm talking about ah, male figures.<br>
I never had a father. My father left me when I was<br>
um - 5 years old. He has 47 kids in Philippines,<br>
and I’m the oldest one. And<br>
he wrote a book about me, In chicago, and um, he made a lot of money,<br>
but he never came to say hello to me.<br>
</p>

<p>
I stood at the edge of the<br>
<span id="props"> lake and watched the duck-<br>
ing </span><br>
<br>
Shes been a mother<br>
and a father, and I’ve been very much appreciative of what shes done.<br>
and I I just wish, I wish you know I’ve - anyone say, any regrets of, your career as being a basketball player?<br>
I said, I have one regret, I wish I was a better father.<br>
</p>

<p>
The pencil counts the lines<br>
of your songs. The sun is<br>
in the firmament<br>
<br>
And this man here, I could hug him because, he’s<br>
the only - he’s the only man that ever cried for me,<br>
you know cause I was really, was really um,<br>
I was really burning both ends of the candle for a long time.<br>
And that’s the reason why I say there - that I'm surprised I'm still here.<br>
And not everyone knows that. But ah. I’d like to set the record<br>
straight, just for the time being.<br>
And maybe hope for that in the future, that I<br>
could actually try to be somewhat of a good - good individual,<br>
and a good father<br>
to my kids. And ah hopefully that I can love you like<br>
I used to when I was born. And ah, thank you guys.<br>
</p>

<p>
This letter cannot be written<br>
because it is not there.<br>
<br>
Me and my mother have never got along,<br>
and - you know, I was never a<br>
very good kid when I was young. And once I became to the age of 16, 19, 20,<br>
I could care less what I did to my mother<br>
and my mother worked 3 jobs. And she she kicked<br>
me out the house, she said, you know<br>
you have to leave here, because you know - I can’t take you anymore.<br>
And I resented her for a long time.<br>
And It’s hard for me to even say this, because I -<br>
my mother rarely ever hugged me or my siblings, she didn’t know how.<br>
</p>

<p>
B B B to separate does hurt.<br>
always tributary in the crossroads,<br>
the wood falls in whining odes,<br>
B B B to separate does hurt.<br>
B B B to separate does hurt.<br>
Wood disheartened in the holloway,<br>
the wood lies at the crossroads,<br>
B B B to separate does hurt.<br>
<br>
<span id="props">And today is</span><br>
A great day for everybody.<br>
Singapore, Tokyo, China, It's a great day<br>
- I’m here to see it. I’m so happy.<br>
<br>
The mother tongue is fine and<br>
graceful. It is good and harsh.<br>
I will not forget this.<br>
This is far too little. One for<br>
another time. Love the beautiful<br>
Love You. are so pretty<br>
